# tusi_couple

# Introduction
The Tusi couple is a mathematical device in which a small circle rotates inside a larger circle twice the diameter of the smaller circle. Rotations of the circles cause a point on the circumference of the smaller circle to oscillate back and forth in linear motion along a diameter of the larger circle.

# Code
tusi.py is a program which simulate a Tusi couple, having two circles with radius 'x' and '2x', such that it accepts an input parameter 'd' on the chord of the inner circle and the path traced are returned as a list of coordinates.
